      <description>&lt;p&gt;If interest is in comparing the means of two (normally distributed) samples it is common practise to perform a two-sample t-test and report the corresponding p-value. Nevertheless, it has been widely criticized that the p-value does not provide a measure for the magnitude of the mean effect (e.g., Browne (2010)). This report provides an overview of existing alternatives recently published in the scientific literature that provide a more meaningful measurement of the effect size. Browne (2010) introduced closed form equations to translate a significant t-test p-value and sample size into the probability of one treatment being more successful than another on a per individual basis. This term was afterwards denoted as win probability by Hayter (2013) and he demonstrated the interpretation as &amp;ldquo;what would happen if a single future observation were to be taken from either of the two treatments, with attention being directed towards which treatment would win by providing the better value.&amp;rdquo; In addition Hayter (2013) introduced the corresponding confidence interval as well as the odds of X being greater than Y. He further introduced the transformation into Cohens effect size and the corresponding confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
