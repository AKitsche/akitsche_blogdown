It resides predominantly in the inner membrane where it interacts with components of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain. CL deficiency has previously been shown to affect abundances of the plant NADH-dehydrogenase complex and its association with dimeric cyctochrome c reductase. Using an Arabidopsis thaliana knock-out mutant for the final enzyme of CL biosynthesis we here extend current knowledge on the dependence of plant respiration on CL. By correlating respiratory enzyme abundances with enzymatic capacities in mitochondria isolated from wild type, CL deficient and CL complemented heterotrophic cell culture lines a new picture of the participation of CL in plant respiration is emerging. Data indicate a loss of a general reduction of respiratory capacity in CL deficient mitochondria which cannot solely be attributed to decreased abundances or capacities of mitochondrial electron transfer protein complexes and supercomplexes. Instead, it most likely is the result of a loss of the mobile electron carrier cytochrome c. Furthermore, enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are found to have lower maximum activities in the mutant, including the succinate dehydrogenase complex. Interestingly, abundance of the latter is not altered, indicative of a direct impact of CL deficiency on the enzymatic capacity of this electron transfer chain protein complex.","tags":null,"title":"Cardiolipin supports respiratory enzymes in plants in different ways","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Kitsche","C Ritz","LA Hothorn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"7f502ca426a00b0c39324fa0893b339f","permalink":"/publication/humanheredity_kitsche_etal/humanheredity_kitsche_etal/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/humanheredity_kitsche_etal/humanheredity_kitsche_etal/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: In this study, we present a simultaneous inference procedure as a unified analysis framework for genetic association studies.

The basic advantage of this methodology is that no explicit formulation of the correlation between the test statistics is required. Moreover, the genotype scores are considered as a quantitative explanatory variable, i.e., regression models are used. Results: The proposed approach covers a wide variety of endpoints (binary, count, quantitative, and time-to-event data). In addition, multiple endpoints of different types can be assessed simultaneously. This allows the detection of pleiotropic effects while taking the mode of inheritance into account. Moreover, multiple loci can be assessed simultaneously.

The evaluation of such trials by analysis of variance (anova) and the corresponding F-tests for the interaction effects covers only a global decision concerning the presence of interactions. This study presents a straightforward method, which provides a more detailed analysis of interactions via multiple contrast tests. The presented approach takes both the structure of each factor and the research question into account by building user-defined product-type contrasts. Simultaneous inference for these user-specified interaction contrasts that controls the overall error rate is available. In addition to adjusted P-values, it is recommended to use simultaneous confidence intervals to present the magnitude, direction and the biological relevance of the interaction effects. The proposed method is demonstrated using two horticultural trials.

Additionally, the control group observes values that are zero or near-to-zero for endpoints characterizing pathological processes. In such instances, the comparison of dose groups versus control requires special attention as inference for ratio-to-control is infeasible or unstable and inference for difference-to-control is highly sensitive to the number of zeros or near-to-zero values. In practice, assays are commonly performed multiple times in a laboratory so that data of some historical controls are available. When the concurrent control values fall within a corresponding normal range, the evaluation is performed by comparing doses versus the concurrent control. If the data of the concurrent control are outside the normal range, a test versus the concurrent control has either an increased risk of a false-positive result or an increased risk of a false-negative result, depending on the direction of the deviation. In this work, we discuss a simple to use Williams-type approach for comparing against a mean historical value.

The focus lies on the detection of qualitative interactions. In addition, the presented method is useful more generally, as it can assess the inconsistency of the treatment effects among strata by using an a priori-defined inconsistency margin. The methodology presented is based on the construction of ratios of treatment effects. In addition to multiplicity-adjusted p-values, simultaneous confidence intervals are recommended to use in detecting the source and the amount of a potential qualitative interaction. The proposed method is demonstrated on a multi-regional trial using the open-source statistical software R.","tags":null,"title":"Detecting qualitative interactions in clinical trials with binary responses","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This talk was part of the International Conference on Simultaneous Inference.\n","date":1379973600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1379973600,"objectID":"0b19793b16427268715d8587198ff9ac","permalink":"/talk/testing-for-qualitative-interaction-using-ratios-of-treatment-differences/","publishdate":"2013-09-24T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/testing-for-qualitative-interaction-using-ratios-of-treatment-differences/","section":"event","summary":"This talk was part of the International Conference on Simultaneous Inference.","tags":null,"title":"Testing for qualitative interaction using ratios of treatment differences","type":"event"},{"authors":["A Kitsche","M Kalesse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1368144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1368144000,"objectID":"616ed9946dd2997e7b8bec1b63c4de64","permalink":"/publication/phh_kitsche_kalesse/phh_kitsche_kalesse/","publishdate":"2013-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phh_kitsche_kalesse/phh_kitsche_kalesse/","section":"publication","summary":"Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) were used to predict the configuration of secondary alcohols and α-methyl branches of modular polyketides. Based on the configurations of two chiral centers in these polyketides, 78 ketoreductases were classified into four different types of polyketide producers. The identification of positions that discriminate between these protein families was followed by fitting six profile HMMs to the data set and the corresponding subsets, to model the conserved regions of the protein types. Ultimately, the profile HMMs described herein predict protein subtypes based on the complete information-rich region; consequently, slight changes in a multiple sequence alignment do not significantly alter the outcome of this classification method. Additionally, Viterbi scores can be used to assess the reliability of the classification.","tags":null,"title":"Configurational assignment of secondary hydroxyl groups and methyl branches in polyketide natural products through bioinformatic analysis of the ketoreductase domain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Kitsche","LA Hothorn","F Schaarschmidt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356912000,"objectID":"23c45825706377a341c1ae2a15e47838","permalink":"/publication/csda_kitsche_etal/csda_kitsche_etal/","publishdate":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/csda_kitsche_etal/csda_kitsche_etal/","section":"publication","summary":"In a typical toxicity bioassay, an untreated control group and several groups of increasing dosage are studied. The use of historical control data from previous trials provides additional information for statistical analysis. It is assumed that dichotomous response variables (e.g., dead/alive) can be suitably analyzed through the comparison of binomial proportions, where any confounding effects on the observed rates are presumed to be absent. Binomial proportions from historical control groups are used to estimate the parameters of a beta prior distribution. Using this beta prior allows knowledge from the historical control data to be applied to a current bioassay. Although trend tests for this situation have been proposed, our main focus is directed towards the construction of simultaneous confidence intervals allowing for an interpretation both in terms of statistical significance and biological relevance. The performance of the proposed approach was investigated in simulation studies for a wide range of potential scenarios. In many cases, the new approach is more powerful and less conservative than a common approach. The method is illustrated by evaluating a long-term carcinogenicity example from the literature.","tags":null,"title":"The use of historical controls in estimating simultaneous confidence intervals for comparisons against a concurrent control","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This talk was part of the XXVIth International Biometric Conference Kobe, Japan.\n","date":1346104800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346104800,"objectID":"80a88f30e0c99022573aa43be50f44e3","permalink":"/talk/assessment-of-the-heterogeneity-of-the-treatment-effect-among-subgroups-by-detecting-qualitative-interactions/","publishdate":"2012-08-28T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/assessment-of-the-heterogeneity-of-the-treatment-effect-among-subgroups-by-detecting-qualitative-interactions/","section":"event","summary":"This talk was part of the XXVIth International Biometric Conference Kobe, Japan.","tags":null,"title":"Assessment of the Heterogeneity of the Treatment Effect among Subgroups by Detecting Qualitative Interactions","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This talk was held at the Journal Club at the Institute of Biostatistics Hannover, Germany.\n","date":1321830000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1321830000,"objectID":"7064659619f79a1c82002f7f7c9f3d5f","permalink":"/talk/bayesian-model-averaging/","publishdate":"2011-11-21T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bayesian-model-averaging/","section":"event","summary":"This talk was held at the Journal Club at the Institute of Biostatistics Hannover, Germany.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Model Averaging","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This talk was held at the Journal Club at the Institute of Biostatistics Hannover, Germany.\n","date":1320793200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1320793200,"objectID":"63ef8ddcb017058b11c0a7bf739040fc","permalink":"/talk/display-multiple-comparisons/","publishdate":"2011-11-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/display-multiple-comparisons/","section":"event","summary":"This talk was held at the Journal Club at the Institute of Biostatistics Hannover, Germany.","tags":null,"title":"Display Multiple Comparisons","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This talk was part of the 2nd conference of the Central European Network Zurich, Switzerland.\n","date":1315778400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1315778400,"objectID":"de3a31a6a9172e4e017276b8cda215b1","permalink":"/talk/evaluation-of-interaction-effects-with-user-defined-contrasts-in-the-cell-means-model/","publishdate":"2011-09-12T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/evaluation-of-interaction-effects-with-user-defined-contrasts-in-the-cell-means-model/","section":"event","summary":"This talk was part of the 2nd conference of the Central European Network Zurich, Switzerland.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of interaction effects with user defined contrasts in the cell means model","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This talk was part of the Non-Clinical Statistics Conference Lyon, France.\n","date":1285538400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285538400,"objectID":"c7bcaedf23ac90e6f5a5ca9726e46825","permalink":"/talk/simultaneous-confidence-intervals-incorporating-historical-control-data/","publishdate":"2010-09-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/simultaneous-confidence-intervals-incorporating-historical-control-data/","section":"event","summary":"This talk was part of the Non-Clinical Statistics Conference Lyon, France.","tags":null,"title":"Simultaneous confidence intervals incorporating historical control data","type":"event"}]
