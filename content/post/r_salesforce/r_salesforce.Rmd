```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

Hey folks,

this blog post will give a short introduction on how to connect [salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com) with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
According to [Takekatsu Hiramura](http://de.gravatar.com/hiratake55) 

> R statistical computing environment is the most populous statistical computing software, and Salesforce.com is the world´s most innovative cloud-computing based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) CRM package.

To connect R with salesforce.com Takekatsu Hiramura developed the R add-on package [RForcecom](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RForcecom/). The source code of the package is available from [github](https://github.com/hiratake55/RForcecom). You can install the package from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/):

```{r eval = FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("RForcecom")
library(RForcecom)
```

To sign in to salesforce.com we can use the `rforcecom.login()` function. We have to set the `username`, `password`, `instanceURL`, `apiVersion` arguments as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
username <- "yourname@yourcompany.com"
password <- "YourPasswordSECURITY_TOKEN"
instanceURL <- "https://login.salesforce.com/"
apiVersion <- "26.0"
(session <- rforcecom.login(username, password, instanceURL, apiVersion))
```

Please note: do not forget your security token in the password field. The [Salesforce community](https://success.salesforce.com/answers?id=90630000000glADAAY) shows how to reset the security token.


Unfortunatly we probably get an error: *Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : Couldn't resolve host name*, because the corporate network environment uses HTTP Proxy. To pick out the proxy setting we can use the `ie_proxy_info()` function from the [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/curl/index.html) R add-on package.:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("curl")
library(curl)
ie_proxy_info()
```


Obviously the corporate network environment uses a global [proxy auto-configuration (PUC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config) file that defines how web browsers and other user agents can automatically choose the appropriate proxy server. We can get the info of the proxy for a specific URL using the `ie_get_proxy_for_url()` function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ie_get_proxy_for_url(target_url = "https://login.salesforce.com/")
```
The function returns a character string with two proxies and their corresponding port. We will further use the first proxy displayed: **. Now we have to set the proxy configurations with the `set_config()` and  ` use_proxy()` functions from the [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) R add-on package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("httr")
library(httr)
proxy_for_url <- "your proxy" #from ie_get_proxy_for_url(target_url = "https://login.salesforce.com/")
port_for_url  <- 8080
set_config(
  use_proxy(url = proxy_for_url", 
            port = port_for_url,
            username = "windows_username", 
            password = "windows_password", 
            auth = "ntlm")
)
```

Under some circumstances you will get the following error message at this point: *Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)*. 
In this case your security certificate, e.g. *curl-ca-bundle.crt* is located in the wrong folder. You have to paste the file into *C:/mingw64/ssl/certs*.

Et voilà, we reached our goal to connect R with salesforce.com:


```{r eval = FALSE}
session <- rforcecom.login(username = username, password = password, loginURL = instanceURL, apiVersion = apiVersion)
session
```
Use the function `rforcecom.retrieve()` to retrieve a dataset:
```{r eval = FALSE}
rforcecom.retrieve(session = session, 
                   objectName = "Contact", 
                   fields = c("ID", "Name"), 
                   limit = 50)
```

After setting up our environment these procedures are very easy and are very useful for projects using R and Salesforce.com. Please let me know if you have any further questions or suggestions.
